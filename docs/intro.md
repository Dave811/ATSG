After a lot of work, mainly done by **Gagipro**, **Ciotto** and **Fourmi**, the Community managed to port the Display firmware, originally conceived by BTT for their TFT with STM32 chip.

Initially the distribution of the Artillery printers, for the Sidewinder X2 and Genius Pro models, took place with TFTs based on the same chip, therefore a new firmware could be installed, different from the one supplied by the parent company which made it easier for the user to set up. Towards the middle of last year the Display chip was replaced with a GD32, which made it impossible to replace the stock firmware with the BTT one until yesterday.

As mentioned after many hours of work and the help of the community we can now replace the stock firmware of our printers with a more performing one which guarantees us, without the aid of external software, access to all the possibilities offered by the new Marlins, which the community is gradually compiling.

Therefore, after many thanks, we want to offer you a point of reference for installing the new firmware for the display and also an ad hoc compiled Marlin 2.1.2.

**IMPORTANT!!! YOU MAKE THIS MODIFICATION AT YOUR OWN RISK, THE SITE MANAGERS, DEVELOPERS AND CONTRIBUTORS WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE IN ANY WAY FOR ANY DAMAGES THAT YOUR PRINTER MAY SUFFER!!!**
